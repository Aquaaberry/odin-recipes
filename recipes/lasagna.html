<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its layers of rich flavors and textures. At its core, lasagna consists of wide,
flat pasta sheets layered with a hearty combination of tangy tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and savory meat such as beef,
pork, or sausage, though vegetarian variations with vegetables or cheese are also popular. Each layer is generously adorned
with a blend of mozzarella, Parmesan, or ricotta cheese, infusing every bite with a decadent, melty richness. The dish is then
baked until the pasta is tender and the cheese on top forms a golden crust, creating a harmonious fusion of flavors and aromas.
Lasagna is not only a comforting and satisfying meal but also a culinary masterpiece that embodies the essence of Italian cuisine.</p>
