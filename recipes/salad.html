<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A wedge salad is a timeless and elegant dish that presents a refreshing twist on the traditional salad.
At its heart lies a crisp and crunchy wedge of iceberg lettuce, which serves as the canvas for a symphony of flavors and textures.
The iceberg lettuce is typically adorned with a lavish drizzle of creamy blue cheese dressing, whose tangy richness perfectly
complements the subtle sweetness of the lettuce. Sprinkled on top are generous portions of crispy bacon bits, adding a savory
crunch and smoky depth to each bite. Finishing touches often include vibrant cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions, and perhaps
a sprinkle of chives or parsley, offering bursts of color and freshness. With its simplicity and sophistication, a wedge salad is not
just a starter but a culinary experience that tantalizes the taste buds and delights the senses.</p>
